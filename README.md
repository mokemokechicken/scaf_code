# scaf_code

scaf_code is an innovative command-line tool designed to streamline the process of generating code. By leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models, scaf_code can transform your reference and specification files into working code that meets your project's requirements.

## Features

- **Code Generation**: Generate code that adheres to your specifications using reference files.
- **Support for Images**: Include images as references for visual specifications.
- **Customizable**: Use command-line options to tailor the code generation process to your needs.
- **Easy to Install**: Get started quickly with a simple pip command.

## Installation

To install scaf_code, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install scaf_code
```

## Configuration

Before using scaf_code, you need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
```

## Usage

To use scaf_code, you'll need to provide reference files, a specification, and an output path. Here's the basic syntax:

```bash
scaf_code --ref <ref_file>... --spec "<spec_text>" --out <output_path>
```

You can also specify a specification file instead of inline text:

```bash
scaf_code --ref <ref_file>... --spec-file <spec_file> --out <output_path>
```

### Options

- `--ref`: One or more reference files. Images are supported with `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, and `.webp` extensions.
- `--spec`: The specification text describing what code to generate.
- `--spec-file`: A file containing the specification text.
- `--out`: The path to the output file where the generated code will be saved.

## Examples

### Generating Code from Text Specifications

To generate a Python test file based on existing code files and a text specification:

```bash
scaf_code --out tests/test_scaffold_code.py --ref scaf_code/cli.py scaf_code/scaffold_code.py --spec "write pytest to scaf_code.scaffold_code.py"
```

### Using Images as References

To generate code that processes an image according to an algorithm specified in a reference image:

```bash
scaf_code --out tests/test_image_processing.py --ref image_processing_algorithm.jpg --spec "write a function to process an image according to the algorithm specified in the reference image"
```
